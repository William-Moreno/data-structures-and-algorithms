# Quick Sort

Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

## Challenge Description

- Write a blog article that explains and illustrates step-by-step output of a quick sort
- Code a working, tested implementation of Quick Sort based on the provided pseudocode

## Aproach & Efficiency

- Illustrate the algorithm for each step
- Write an explanation of what is transpiring in each iteration/recursion
- Write tests for quick sort function based on suggested input arrays
- Write `quickSort()`, `partition()` and `swap()` functions in JavaScript
- Test code for validity

- Big O's
  - Time complexity is O(nLogn)
  - Space complexity is O(1)
