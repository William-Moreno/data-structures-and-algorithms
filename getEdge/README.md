# Get Edge

Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

## Challenge

Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Imported graph data structure from previous work
- Wrote `getEdge(graph, array)` function
- Wrote tests for the function
- Tested for functionality

## Solution

[code](./get-edge.js)
